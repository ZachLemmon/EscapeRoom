# EscapeRoom

This is my Capstone project for my CPA program.

# Portfolio Assignment Reflection

By doing this project, I learned how to use a new technology (SFML) to change the text font to use a provided font file, and to create a simple game in a rendered window. 

I believe that doing this project has shown that I am an effective computer programmer analyst because I had to use a mix of learning a new technology and skills, and using my knowledge and skills gained from my previous courses in my CPA program in order to complete it.
